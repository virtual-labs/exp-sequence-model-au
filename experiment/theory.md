### Theory

***

The sequence model makes the detailed structure of a task explicit. They show how the task is broken into activities,
It describe how a particular task done.It is composed of the activities, their steps, the associated intents
and breakdowns. 
###
** Simulation** :  A platform is designed with two parts: the experiment and output simulation. The experiment screen provides the use case document of the chosen case study, and the learner is instructed to choose the right interaction from a list. The simulation component will automatically fill the time sequence diagram based on the experiment.  A correct answer (verifiable from a known solution) allows the student to go to the next level, while a wrong answer points the student to the learning material.
